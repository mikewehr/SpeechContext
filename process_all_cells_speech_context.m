%this is an example script that you can use as a template to process all
%cells in a cell list that you have built using CellListBuilder.

%it's best to send output to the Data directory, since by default the
%Data directory is not backed up to GitHub. And you don't want a bunch of
%data plots on GitHub. We only want general-purpose code to be backed up to
%GitHub.
psfilename='postscript_file_of_all_cells.ps';
%we use postscript because it supports appending multiple figures, and you
%can then open it with a pdf browser such as Adobe Reader or Preview.
%(matlab can print directly to pdf format but then you can't append)

delete(psfilename)
%delete the output file if it already exists

%the path to the data and the cell list will depend on the machine and platform you are
%running on. If you're processing data on a remote machine you probably
%need to mount it first (outside of matlab -i.e. in windows explorer or
%finder).
